This repository contains custom pipes and models related to using spaCy for scientific documents.

In particular, there is a custom tokenizer that adds tokenization rules on top of spaCy's
rule-based tokenizer, a POS tagger and syntactic parser trained on biomedical data and
an entity span detection model. Separately, there are also NER models for more specific tasks.

**Just looking to test out the models on your data? Check out our [demo](https://scispacy.apps.allenai.org)**.


## Installation
Installing scispacy requires two steps: installing the library and intalling the models. To install the library, run:
```bash
pip install scispacy
```

to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:

```bash
pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.2.5/en_core_sci_sm-0.2.5.tar.gz
```

Note: We strongly recommend that you use an isolated Python environment (such as virtualenv or conda) to install scispacy.
Take a look below in the "Setting up a virtual environment" section if you need some help with this.
Additionally, scispacy uses modern features of Python and as such is only available for **Python 3.6 or greater**.



#### Setting up a virtual environment

[Conda](https://conda.io/) can be used set up a virtual environment with the
version of Python required for scispaCy.  If you already have a Python 3.6 or 3.7
environment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section.

1.  [Follow the installation instructions for Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda#regular-installation).

2.  Create a Conda environment called "scispacy" with Python 3.6:

    ```bash
    conda create -n scispacy python=3.6
    ```

3.  Activate the Conda environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy.

    ```bash
    source activate scispacy
    ```

Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above.


Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:
```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")
doc = nlp("Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.")
```

#### Note on upgrading
If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have.

## Additional Pipeline Components


### AbbreviationDetector
The AbbreviationDetector is a Spacy component which implements the abbreviation detection algorithm in "A simple algorithm
    for identifying abbreviation definitions in biomedical text.", (Schwartz & Hearst, 2003).

You can access the list of abbreviations via the `doc._.abbreviations` attribute and for a given abbreviation,
you can access it's long form (which is a `spacy.tokens.Span`) using `span._.long_form`, which will point to
another span in the document.


#### Example Usage

```python
import spacy

from scispacy.abbreviation import AbbreviationDetector

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")

# Add the abbreviation pipe to the spacy pipeline.
abbreviation_pipe = AbbreviationDetector(nlp)
nlp.add_pipe(abbreviation_pipe)

doc = nlp("Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \
           inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \
           of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \
           SBMA can be caused by this easily.")

print("Abbreviation", "\t", "Definition")
for abrv in doc._.abbreviations:
	print(f"{abrv} \t ({abrv.start}, {abrv.end}) {abrv._.long_form}")

>>> Abbreviation	 Span	    Definition
>>> SBMA 		 (33, 34)   Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy
>>> SBMA 	   	 (6, 7)     Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy
>>> AR   		 (29, 30)   androgen receptor
```
### EntityLinker

The `EntityLinker` is a SpaCy component which performs linking to a knowledge base. The linker simply performs
a string overlap - based search (char-3grams) on named entities, comparing them with the concepts in a knowledge base
using an approximate nearest neighbours search.

Currently (v2.5.0), there are 5 supported linkers:

- `umls`: Links to the [Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html), levels 0,1,2 and 9. This has ~3M concepts.
- `mesh`: Links to the [Medical Subject Headings](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html). This contains a smaller set of higher quality entities, which are used for indexing in Pubmed. MeSH contains ~30k entities. NOTE: The MeSH KB is derrived directly from MeSH itself, and as such uses different unique identifiers than the other KBs.
- `rxnorm`: Links to the [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html) ontology. RxNorm contains ~100k concepts focused on normalized names for clinical drugs. It is comprised of several other drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction, including First Databank, Micromedex, and the Gold Standard Drug Database.
- `go`: Links to the [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/). The Gene Ontology contains ~67k concepts focused on the functions of genes.
- `hpo`: Links to the [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/). The Human Phenotype Ontology contains 16k concepts focused on phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease.

You may want to play around with some of the parameters
below to adapt to your use case (higher precision, higher recall etc).

- `resolve_abbreviations : bool = True, optional (default = False)`
    Whether to resolve abbreviations identified in the Doc before performing linking.
    This parameter has no effect if there is no `AbbreviationDetector` in the spacy
    pipeline.
- `k : int, optional, (default = 30)`
    The number of nearest neighbours to look up from the candidate generator per mention.
- `threshold : float, optional, (default = 0.7)`
    The threshold that a mention candidate must reach to be added to the mention in the Doc
    as a mention candidate.
-   `no_definition_threshold : float, optional, (default = 0.95)`
        The threshold that a entity candidate must reach to be added to the mention in the Doc
        as a mention candidate if the entity candidate does not have a definition.
- `filter_for_definitions: bool, default = True`
    Whether to filter entities that can be returned to only include those with definitions
    in the knowledge base.
- `max_entities_per_mention : int, optional, default = 5`
    The maximum number of entities which will be returned for a given mention, regardless of
    how many are nearest neighbours are found.

This class sets the `._.kb_ents` attribute on spacy Spans, which consists of a
List[Tuple[str, float]] corresponding to the KB concept_id and the associated score
for a list of `max_entities_per_mention` number of entities.

You can look up more information for a given id using the kb attribute of this class:
```
print(linker.kb.cui_to_entity[concept_id])
```

#### Example Usage
```python
import spacy
import scispacy

from scispacy.linking import EntityLinker

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")

# This line takes a while, because we have to download ~1GB of data
# and load a large JSON file (the knowledge base). Be patient!
# Thankfully it should be faster after the first time you use it, because
# the downloads are cached.
# NOTE: The resolve_abbreviations parameter is optional, and requires that
# the AbbreviationDetector pipe has already been added to the pipeline. Adding
# the AbbreviationDetector pipe and setting resolve_abbreviations to True means
# that linking will only be performed on the long form of abbreviations.
linker = EntityLinker(resolve_abbreviations=True, name="umls")

nlp.add_pipe(linker)

doc = nlp("Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \
           inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \
           of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \
           SBMA can be caused by this easily.")

# Let's look at a random entity!
entity = doc.ents[1]

print("Name: ", entity)
>>> Name: bulbar muscular atrophy

# Each entity is linked to UMLS with a score
# (currently just char-3gram matching).
for umls_ent in entity._.kb_ents:
	print(linker.kb.cui_to_entity[umls_ent[0]])


>>> CUI: C1839259, Name: Bulbo-Spinal Atrophy, X-Linked

```

### Hearst Patterns (v3.0)

This component implements [Automatic Aquisition of Hyponyms from Large Text Corpora](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C92-2082.pdf) using the SpaCy Matcher component.

Passing `extended=True` to the `HyponymDetector` will use the extended set of hearst patterns, which include higher recall but lower precision hyponymy relations (e.g X compared to Y, X similar to Y, etc).

This component produces a doc level attribute on the spacy doc: `doc._.hearst_patterns`, which is a list containing tuples of extracted hyponym pairs. The tuples contain:

- The relation rule used to extract the hyponym (type: `str`)
- The more general concept  (type: `spacy.Span`)
- The more specific concept (type: `spacy.Span`)


#### Usage:

```python
import spacy
from scispacy.hyponym_detector import HyponymDetector

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")
hyponym_pipe = HyponymDetector(nlp, extended=True)
nlp.add_pipe(hyponym_pipe, last=True)

doc = nlp("Keystone plant species such as fig trees are good for the soil.")

print(doc._.hearst_patterns)
>>> [('such_as', Keystone plant species, fig trees)]
```
